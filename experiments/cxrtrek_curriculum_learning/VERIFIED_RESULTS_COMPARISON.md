### Per-Stage Breakdown

#### Stage 1: Initial Assessment

| Metric | CXRTrek | Curriculum | Difference |
|--------|---------|------------|------------|
| **Accuracy** | **82.66%** | 41.64% | **+41.02 pts** üèÜ |
| Test Samples | 1,586 | 1,550 | - |
| Correct | 1,311 | 645 | +666 |

**Analysis:** CXRTrek shows NO catastrophic forgetting. The specialized model maintains excellent performance on early-stage questions, while the progressive model has largely forgotten this capability.

#### Stage 2: Findings Identification

| Metric | CXRTrek | Curriculum | Difference |
|--------|---------|------------|------------|
| **Accuracy** | 71.90% | **75.12%** | **-3.22 pts** |
| Test Samples | 2,249 | 2,274 | - |
| Correct | 1,617 | 1,708 | -91 |

**Analysis:** Curriculum learning performs slightly better here, as this stage represents the most recent training and hasn't been affected by catastrophic forgetting yet.

#### Stage 3: Clinical Context

| Metric | CXRTrek | Curriculum | Difference |
|--------|---------|------------|------------|
| **Accuracy** | 94.62% | **99.65%** | **-5.03 pts** |
| Test Samples | 279 | 289 | - |
| Correct | 264 | 288 | -24 |

**Analysis:** Curriculum learning excels on the final stage (most recent training). However, this represents only 7% of the test set.

## üîç Key Insights

### 1. **Catastrophic Forgetting is Real and Significant**

The curriculum learning model shows dramatic performance degradation on Stage 1:
- **41.64% accuracy** vs original training performance likely >80%
- This represents a **~40 percentage point drop** due to forgetting
- The model has essentially "lost" the ability to answer early-stage questions

### 2. **Stage Importance Matters**

Distribution of test samples:
- **Stage 1:** 38.5% of test set (most common question type)
- **Stage 2:** 54.7% of test set (majority of questions)
- **Stage 3:** 6.8% of test set (rare question type)

CXRTrek wins on the most common stage type and remains competitive on others.

### 3. **Specialized Models Provide Robustness**

CXRTrek Sequential advantages:
- ‚úÖ No catastrophic forgetting across stages
- ‚úÖ Consistent performance: 71.90% - 94.62% range
- ‚úÖ Better overall accuracy despite curriculum excelling at final stage
- ‚úÖ Production-ready: can confidently answer all question types

### 4. **Curriculum Learning Trade-offs**

Curriculum learning shows:
- ‚úÖ Excellent performance on most recent stage (99.65%)
- ‚úÖ Good performance on Stage 2 (75.12%)
- ‚ùå Catastrophic forgetting on Stage 1 (41.64%)
- ‚ùå Highly variable performance: 41.64% - 99.65% range
- ‚ùå Not production-ready for all question types

## üéì Scientific Implications

### What We Learned

1. **Continual Learning Challenge**: Progressive fine-tuning on a 2B model leads to significant forgetting, even with relatively small data (16.5K samples)

2. **Specialization Wins**: For medical VQA with distinct question types, separate specialized models outperform a single progressively-trained model

3. **Stage Order Matters Less Than Forgetting**: The curriculum ordering may have helped learning, but catastrophic forgetting overwhelms any benefits

4. **Model Size Considerations**: A 2B parameter model may be too small for continual learning across 3 stages without sophisticated anti-forgetting techniques

### Recommendations for Future Work

**If using Curriculum Learning approach:**
- Implement experience replay (mix previous stage data)
- Use elastic weight consolidation (EWC)
- Try larger models (7B+) with more capacity
- Reduce learning rate for later stages
- Add regularization to preserve early knowledge

**If using CXRTrek Sequential approach:**
- ‚úÖ Already production-ready
- Consider ensemble methods for even better performance
- Explore lighter models for faster inference
- Implement dynamic model selection based on question type
