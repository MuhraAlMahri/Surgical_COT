## üîç Key Insights

### 1. CXRTrek Sequential: The Clear Winner

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ **Best overall accuracy:** 77.59%
- ‚úÖ **No catastrophic forgetting:** 82.66% on Stage 1
- ‚úÖ **Consistent performance:** 71.90% - 94.62% range
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready:** Reliable across all question types
- ‚úÖ **Modular:** Can update individual stage models

**Why it works:**
- Three specialized models, each expert in one stage
- Sequential inference with context passing
- No forgetting because models don't overwrite each other

### 2. Curriculum Learning: Catastrophic Forgetting

**Performance:**
- Overall: 64.24% (same as random baseline!)
- Stage 1: **41.64%** ‚ö†Ô∏è (massive forgetting)
- Stage 2: 75.12% (good, recent training)
- Stage 3: 99.65% (excellent, most recent training)

**What went wrong:**
- Progressive fine-tuning caused model to forget Stage 1
- **~40 percentage point drop** from expected ~82% to actual 41.64%
- The 2B model lacks capacity for continual learning without anti-forgetting techniques

**Not production-ready:**
- Would fail on 38% of real-world questions (Stage 1)
- Unreliable for medical deployment

### 3. Qwen Ordering: Modest Improvement

**Performance:**
- Overall: 67.12%
- +2.88 percentage points vs random ordering
- Consistent across stages (66.98% - 67.47%)

**Insights:**
- LLM-based semantic categorization helps slightly
- Not enough to justify complexity vs random ordering
- CXRTrek's specialized approach is far better (+10.47 points)

### 4. Random Ordering: Solid Baseline

**Performance:**
- Overall: 64.24%
- Consistent across stages (64.09% - 65.05%)
- Simple and reliable

## üèÜ Performance Comparison

### CXRTrek vs Curriculum Learning

**Overall Winner:** CXRTrek by **+13.35 percentage points**

| Metric | CXRTrek | Curriculum | Difference |
|--------|---------|------------|------------|
| **Overall** | **77.59%** | 64.24% | **+13.35 pts** |
| Stage 1 | **82.66%** | 41.64% | **+41.02 pts** üèÜ |
| Stage 2 | 71.90% | **75.12%** | -3.22 pts |
| Stage 3 | 94.62% | **99.65%** | -5.03 pts |

**Interpretation:**
- CXRTrek dominates on Stage 1 (most common question type)
- Curriculum does better on Stages 2 & 3 (recent training)
- But overall, **specialized models >> progressive training**

### CXRTrek vs All Other Approaches

| Comparison | Difference |
|------------|------------|
| CXRTrek vs Qwen | **+10.47 pts** |
| CXRTrek vs Random | **+13.35 pts** |
| CXRTrek vs Curriculum | **+13.35 pts** |

## üí° Scientific Contributions

### What We Learned

1. **Specialized Models Win:** For medical VQA with distinct question types, separate specialized models outperform a single progressively-trained model

2. **Catastrophic Forgetting is Real:** Progressive fine-tuning on a 2B model leads to severe forgetting, even with only 3 stages and 16.5K samples

3. **Model Capacity Matters:** Smaller models (2B) may not have enough capacity for continual learning without sophisticated anti-forgetting techniques

4. **Semantic Ordering Helps (Slightly):** LLM-based question categorization provides modest gains but is not a game-changer

5. **Production vs Research Trade-offs:** 
   - Research: Curriculum learning is interesting but needs more work
   - Production: Specialized models are more reliable and deployable

### Recommendations

**For Deployment:**
- ‚úÖ Use **CXRTrek Sequential** (77.59%)
- Reliable, consistent, production-ready
- Accept deployment complexity for better accuracy

**For Future Research on Curriculum Learning:**
- Implement **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)**
- Use **experience replay** (mix previous stage data)
- Try **larger models** (7B+ parameters)
- Consider **Progressive Neural Networks**
- Add **adapter-based modular designs**

**For Future CXRTrek Improvements:**
- Try larger base models (Qwen2-VL-7B)
- Implement ensemble methods
- Optimize inference speed
- Cross-dataset evaluation
