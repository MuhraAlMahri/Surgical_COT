## üî¨ Overview

This project investigates whether **stage-wise training strategies** can improve medical VQA performance by organizing questions into a clinical reasoning hierarchy:

1. **Stage 1 - Initial Assessment**: Quality control, procedure identification, artifact detection
2. **Stage 2 - Findings Identification**: Abnormalities, instruments, anatomical landmarks
3. **Stage 3 - Clinical Context**: Diagnosis, clinical reasoning, treatment recommendations

We compare **four different approaches** to organizing and training on these stages using the **Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct** vision-language model.

---

## üéØ Research Question

**Does organizing medical VQA training by clinical reasoning stages improve model performance?**

We test this by comparing:
- **Sequential specialized models** (one model per stage)
- **Progressive curriculum learning** (one model trained stage-by-stage)
- **LLM-based curriculum** (questions ordered by Qwen2.5-7B difficulty)
- **Random ordering baseline** (no organization)

---

  - Stage 2 Model ‚Üí trained only on Stage 2 questions  
  - Stage 3 Model ‚Üí trained only on Stage 3 questions
- **Inference**: Route questions to the appropriate specialized model
- **Result**: **77.59%** overall accuracy (+10.47 pts vs Qwen ordering)

### Stage Categorization (Automated)

Questions are categorized using **Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct** LLM with the following prompt:

```
STAGE 1 - INITIAL ASSESSMENT: Quality control, procedure type, artifacts
STAGE 2 - FINDINGS IDENTIFICATION: Abnormalities, instruments, landmarks
STAGE 3 - CLINICAL CONTEXT: Diagnosis, reasoning, clinical significance
```

**Distribution**:
- Stage 1 (Initial): ~38% of questions (1,586 test samples)
- Stage 2 (Findings): ~55% of questions (2,249 test samples)
- Stage 3 (Clinical): ~7% of questions (279 test samples)

## üíª Usage

### 1. Data Preparation

First, categorize your questions into clinical stages:

```bash
# Categorize questions using Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct LLM
cd experiments/cxrtrek_curriculum_learning
python scripts/categorize_questions_llm.py \
    --input_file data/qa_pairs_train.json \
    --output_dir data/ \
    --model_name "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct"
```

### 2. Training

#### Option A: CXRTrek Sequential (Recommended ‚úÖ)

Train three independent specialized models:

```bash
# Stage 1 Model

## üìà Results

### Overall Performance Comparison

| Experiment | Overall Acc | Stage 1 | Stage 2 | Stage 3 | Training Time | Status |
|------------|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------------|--------|
| **CXRTrek Sequential** | **77.59%** | 82.66% | 71.90% | **94.62%** | 3x independent | ‚úÖ Best |
| Qwen Ordering | 67.12% | - | - | - | Single run | ‚úÖ Good |
| Curriculum Learning | 64.24% | **41.64%** ‚ö†Ô∏è | **75.12%** | **99.65%** | Progressive | ‚ùå Forgetting |
| Random Baseline | 64.24% | - | - | - | Single run | ‚úÖ Baseline |

### Key Observations

1. **CXRTrek Sequential Wins Overall** (+13.35 pts over Curriculum)
   - Consistent performance across all stages (72-95% range)
   - No catastrophic forgetting
   - Production-ready reliability

2. **Curriculum Learning Shows Severe Forgetting**
   - Stage 1 accuracy drops to 41.64% (vs 82.66% for CXRTrek)
   - Stage 3 reaches 99.65% but at the cost of Stage 1
   - Overall worse than random ordering baseline

3. **Stage 3 (Clinical Reasoning) Is Learnable**
   - Both approaches achieve 94-99% on Stage 3
   - Smallest stage (7% of data) but highest accuracy

4. **Stage 1 Is Critical**
   - Represents 38% of test samples
   - CXRTrek's advantage here (+41 pts) drives overall win

## üîë Key Findings

### ‚úÖ What Works

1. **Specialized Models > Progressive Training**
   - Training separate models per stage avoids catastrophic forgetting
   - Each model becomes an expert in its clinical reasoning stage

2. **Stage-Based Organization Helps**
   - CXRTrek Sequential (77.59%) >> Random (64.24%)
   - Organizing by clinical reasoning stages improves performance

3. **Clinical Stage 3 Is Highly Learnable**
   - Both approaches achieve >94% on diagnosis/reasoning questions
   - Small dataset (7%) sufficient for high performance

### ‚ùå What Doesn't Work

1. **Progressive Curriculum Learning**
   - Severe catastrophic forgetting on early stages
   - Stage 1 drops from ~82% to 41% during Stage 2/3 training
   - Overall performance worse than random ordering

2. **Single Model for All Stages**
   - Cannot maintain performance across diverse clinical reasoning types
   - Trade-off between early and late stage performance

### üéì Implications

**For Medical VQA Deployment:**
- Use **specialized models** (CXRTrek approach)
- Implement **stage classification** to route questions
- Monitor for **catastrophic forgetting** in continual learning

**For Future Research:**
- Investigate continual learning techniques (EWC, experience replay)
- Test with larger models (7B, 14B parameters)
- Explore hybrid approaches (partial specialization)
